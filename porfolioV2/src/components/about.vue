                As a curious developer, I always find myself learning new things to improve my skills and can adapt to
                new technologies within a few days.

                <p>
                I have most of my experience within the front-end space (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but lately, I've been
                working a lot with PHP and MySQL which I like and I find myself pretty confident about.
