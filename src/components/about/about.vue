                        As a curious developer, I always find myself learning new things to improve my skills and can
                        adapt to
                        new technologies within a few days. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional web
                        applications.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I have most of my experience with Vue.js, Next.js/React, and Laravel/PHP. I have also worked
                        with databases like MySQL and MongoDB.
